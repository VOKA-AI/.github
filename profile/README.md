#### About

The Eden is a Web3.0 exclusive Live-Streaming service platform which focusing on decentralized games and AMA interviews on ETH and Polygon network. 
The project will provide 3D NFT avatar generate technology from 2D PFP NFT by using our AI algorithm, and be able to live streaming with the 3D avatars.

#### Mission

In the world of Web2.0, live-streaming has become the popular entertainment activity for daily life. With the advent of the era of Web3.0, current live-streaming platforms cannot meet the needs of Web3.0 users. In the world of Web3.0, people tend to be anonymous or use network identity, so decentralized identity (DID) will become an essential part of Web3.0. However, all live-streaming platforms cannot use DID at present. With the development of Metaverse and AI, the technology of multiplayer interaction will be implemented. Compared with the traditional live-streaming communication, the new type of broadcasting like cloud gaming is not only easy to get the audiences and the KOLs closer, but also create the opportunity for the second social networking between audiences. Therefore, our goal is to build a Web3.0 exclusive Live-Streaming service platform.
